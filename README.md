# Face_recognition
* Face Recognition Python is the latest trend in Machine Learning techniques. OpenCV, the most popular library for computer vision, provides bindings for Python. OpenCV uses machine learning algorithms to search for faces within a picture.</br>
* Facial Recognition is a category of biometric software that maps an individual’s facial features mathematically and stores the data as a faceprint. The software uses Deep algorithms to compare a live capture or digital image to the stored faceprint in order to verify an individual’s identity .</br>
# Installation
